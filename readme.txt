[SMTP King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/smtp-king-pro/) seamlessly enables you to use your own email address to send out emails from your Wordpress site. This will make these
emails appear as if they are being sent directly from you by using your email address in the from field as opposed to Wordpress using the servers generic email address
to send the emails out. Just install and set, SMTP King Pro handles the rest.

[SMTP King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/smtp-king-pro/) allows you to specify your SMTP host, the username and password to connect to your email, the SMTP port if different
from default and what address and name to use as the "from" address.
